# Auto Sales Tracker

Auto Sales Tracker is a web application that acts as a tool to track a car dealership business. Users are able to register, submit their vehicles, contacts, expenses, and tasks in order to better organize their business.

As the user adds tasks, these are able to be associated with vehicles and/or contacts. Transactions can be saved as expenses, services provided, purchases or selling of vehicles. Vehicles will track their tasks and expenses and calculate possible profits upon selling.

The web app utilizes Django with 7 models (Users, Vehicle, Contact, Transaction, Task, CarMake and CarModel) on the back-end and JavaScript on the front-end.

## Motivation
This project was developed as the final project for Harvard's [CS50's Web Programming with Python and Javascript](https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-web-programming-with-python-and-javascript). This was also an attempt to simplify my father's small dealership business where tracking all expenses or tasks related to a specific vehicle or contact can get complicated.

#### Complexity
This project provided a greater challenge than the previous projects for the following reasons:
- It is a unique web app for a real life problem;
- Contains a complex relationship between the created models - transactions/vehicles can be related to contacts, vehicles are related to car makes and models, tasks can be related to either vehicles or contacts, etc...;
- Content is shown with ajax functionality - with no need to reload the page;
- User can change their details, password, or even recover password;
- Users can create/delete contacts, create/delete tasks or mark as done, create vehicles, mark them as sold and finally add expenses/services provided with transactions.
- By inputting the car make, model and year, a Google image search is done and an image is automatically added to display in the garage view;
- The web app is mobile responsive with different displays for different resolutions;
- The JavaScript files needed to output all the relevant information on the front-end through API's required a greater effort.

## Installation
